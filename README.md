# Data Driven StockAnalysis 

The Stock Performance Dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive visualization and analysis of the Nifty 50 stocks' performance over the past year. 
The project will analyze daily stock data, including open, close, high, low, and volume values. 
Clean and process the data, generate key performance insights, and visualize the top-performing stocks in terms of price changes, as well as average stock metrics.
The solution will offer interactive dashboards using Streamlit and Power BI to help Investors, analysts, and enthusiasts make informed decisions based on the stock performance trends.
